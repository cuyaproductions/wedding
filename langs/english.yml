  title: Frequently asked questions
  questions:
    - question: Who will be there?
      answer: We are inviting our families and closest family friends to join us as we all become one big, happy family.
    - question: Do I need a visa?
      answer:
    - question: How do I get to Austin?
      answer: The Austin Bergstrom International Airport (ABIA) is the primary way to get to Austin from outside of Texas. The airport is located 10 miles from downtown, and 17 miles from the wedding venue.
    - question: Where will I stay in Austin?
      answer: There are many great hotels as well as numerous rental options through AirBnB and Homeaway. We recommend staying in the hill country near the wedding venue, or in downtown Austin.
    - question: How will I get around Austin?
      answer: We recommend using services such as Uber, Lyft, Fasten, or Ride Austin. Use the site Ride.Guru to find the best rate for any short trip to get around. For a four-seater, it shouldn't cost more than $20 to get from downtown to the wedding venue.\nIn addition, there are multiple car rental options at the airport.
    - question: How much will this cost me?
      answer:
    - question: Where / what is the wedding venue (like)?
      answer: Our wedding will take place at House on the Hill, which is a spacious, kitschy, woodsy house located in the hill country of west Austin. We're looking forward to having you out here!
    - question: How to dress? What else to expect? What do I need to pack?
      answer: The wedding is in June, which is the middle of the hot Texas summer. We plan to dress only semi-formally, and have no dress code in mind - please dress as comfortably and stylish as you want. The wedding venue has a pool (which you are more than welcome to use!) and we plan to have ample water for folks to cool off throughout the duration of your time out here. In addition, the main house on the property is air conditioned.
    - question: What is Austin like? What is there to do? What is the weather like?
      answer: "Austin is a trendy city with plenty of great food to try and beautiful nature to explore. In late June it can be really hot, with temperatures often topping 100 degrees in the late afternoon. Fortunately there are many ways to enjoy water, with multiple natural springs to swim in near downtown (at a constant 70 degree water year-round) as well as various places to rent kayaks and paddleboards. As well, there are two types of food Austin does best: tacos and barbecue. We'd be happy to give recommendations!"
    - question: Gift situation? (Where is the wedding registry?)
      answer: Pardon the clichÃ©, but we'd love if your presence could be our presents for this celebration! If you feel inclined to give a gift to commemorate this event, we would ask that you make a small donation in our honor to GiveWell, which allocates resources to organizations that improve quality of life and save lives around the world.
